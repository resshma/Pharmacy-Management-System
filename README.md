# Pharmacy-Management-System
Pharmacy system using SQL, Neo4j, and Python for data visualisation 

* This project developed a comprehensive Pharmacy Management System (PMS) using relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (Neo4j) databases to manage pharmacy operations efficiently. 

* It includes data models (EER/UML), SQL and Cypher queries for drug and pharmacy insights, and Python integration for real-time data access and visualization.

* The system enhances accuracy, inventory tracking, and decision-making with interactive charts showing medicine availability, pharmacy locations, and operational trendsâ€”offering a scalable solution for modern healthcare needs.
